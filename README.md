# CAPTAIN's LOG :: Project 4: Around The U.S.

**Description**
This project is my first step of combining javascript and responsive website design together.
As sprint 3 project here in this landing page I did a repsonsive website design, but compared to previous project this had 2 main breakpoints specified - 1280px and mobile viewport 320px.

Design set with the css files with respect to that.

In addition there is a Form which functions with javascript, we are editing Profile Name and Profile Profession elements with the assistance of javascript,the OOP classes & methods.

**Techniques & Tech**
Html and CSS is used for initial responsive design.
Form property of element has been bind to javascript through it's class names given in style sheet.
For Profile Info part the javascript used. For buttons eventListener's added by stating situation and functions. Also button - popup form is binded and making it possible for viewers to input their own values to the form and those changes attained to the page with javascript.
Also mingled with branches - develope branched opened, worked over and merged to main. Like the theory had one conflict and had to correct it manually on file. (The file in main branch is deleted and merge repeated to have a proper one.)

In Project 5th the New Card button activated with the popup menu enabling users to five a name and add a photo picture they would like to in prepend style. Heart shaped like button also made clickable to choose the cards the visitor likes. On top right of each card an additional delete icon added with a trash can icon.

In Project 6 the form validation works done using with another javascript file - validation.js file. This enables the browser to display error messages on the form for the visitors, providing an efficient UI/UX for the given forms.

In Project 7 we set sailed to the new depths. As following our OOP knowledge presented in Sprint 7 the script files are multiplied.  Have cards.js, utils.js, formvalidator.js and finally index.js . Each class has it's own methods; public, private.

In Project 8 we initiated usage of Classes more efficiently and dived deeper through OOP, also learnt about destructuring and magical this. A attribute/ joker element taking place of required or referenced object. You got to love this!
Enchant√© , we also learnt using webpack - welcome to less littered compact world of newage browsers.

In Project 9 welcome to the world of API's,  we implemented api's for all of the functions to fetch, patch, post or delete the information or the cards wholesomely.  The instances we used in classes used togeter with API methods in order to arrange the initiation of functions or validation methods such as resetValidation , disableButton etc.

With this project for the first time we started to communicate with the server and experienced back-end side of the webdevelopment - We used the server to receive, update information  also add and delete cards as well as like and check out which users liked it from the network tool, one of the developer tools.
